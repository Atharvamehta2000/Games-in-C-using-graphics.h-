# Games in C++ using Borland Graphics Interface

We tried to built some interesting games using the TurboC++ graphics.h library. The games are fully functional and working well. Though the games are not platform independent. They work only with DOS emulator.

# How to run them?

Install TurboC++ with MS-DOS emulator. Copy the **bgi** directory that comes with TurboC installation to *C:\\\TurboC3\bgi*. Then compile the cpp files and run the excecutable.

# Screenshots?

Screenshots of the games are stored in **/docs/img** folder under respective names. Also you can view them in slideshow at [Games in C++ | DOS using graphics.h](https://nitinsultania.github.io/Games-in-C-using-graphics.h-/).
